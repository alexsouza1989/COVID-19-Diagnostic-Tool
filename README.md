This is a basic and simple initial version designed to test the implementation of machine learning models without requiring coding, making it easier to use.


## Description

This application leverages **Machine Learning** for COVID-19 diagnosis, enabling CSV data import, statistical analysis, and machine learning model training with cross-validation. The user interface is built with **Tkinter** for ease of use.

## Features

- **Data Import**: Easily load CSV files containing clinical data.
- **Statistical Analysis**: Generate histograms and boxplots to visualize numerical variable distributions.
- **Machine Learning Models**:
  - **Random Forest**
  - **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**
  - **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**
- **Cross-Validation**: Evaluate model performance using 5-fold cross-validation.
- **Visualizations**:
  - Classification Report
  - Confusion Matrix
  - ROC Curve
  - Feature Importance (for Random Forest)

## Technologies Used

- **Python 3.13**
- **Tkinter**: GUI development
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: Visualizations
- **Scikit-learn**: Machine learning models
- **Pillow**: Image processing
- **PyInstaller**: Create executables

**Instructions for Use:**

1. **Copy the entire content** within the triple backticks (```markdown) above.
2. **Paste** it directly into your `README.md` file in your GitHub repository.
3. **Replace placeholders** such as `alexsouza1989`, `Alex`, `alex154237@gmail.com`, and `https://www.linkedin.com/in/alex-fernandes-de-souza-2648325b/` with your actual information.
4. **Verify formatting** by viewing the `README.md` on GitHub to ensure all sections and code blocks appear correctly.

**Note:**
- The link to the executable has been added in the **Executable** section under step 5.
- Ensure that the Google Drive link is accessible to your intended audience.
- If you have multiple executables or different versions, consider using GitHub Releases for better version control and accessibility.

If you encounter any formatting issues after pasting, double-check the markdown syntax, especially the code blocks and links.
